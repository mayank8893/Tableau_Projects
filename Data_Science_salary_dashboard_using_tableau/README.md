# Data_Science_salary_dashboard_using_Tableau

For this project I have created a **Data Science Salary** dashboard using **Tableau** containing information about data science salaries by job location, job title and experience level. The data for this was downloaded from Kaggle and cleaned using SQL. Tableau worksheets were then created to:

1) Display the top 10 countries where employees lived.
2) Display the average salary for each country on a map.
3) Plot a doughnut plot for % of companies by their size.
4) Plot a doughnut plot % of jobs by experience level and % of jobs by employment type.
5) Another plot was created to figure out the average salary by contract type and experience level. Also a table was created to give average salaries for job titles and experience level.
6) Finally a filter was created to change the plots according to job title and company location.

The screenshot below shows the dashboard created from these worksheets. Find the dashboard on tableau public with this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mayank.tripathi3793/viz/DataScienceSalaryDashboard_16900591934480/Dashboard1
