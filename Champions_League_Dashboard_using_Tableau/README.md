# Champions_League_Dashboard_using_Tableau

For this project, I have used dataset for the UEFA Champions League from 1992 to 2021. I have answered questions like top 10 players and coaches by appearances using a radial chart. I have also plotted top 10 clubs by winnings, number of goals for, against  and number of games played divided into wins and losses. In addition, I have plotted the number of titles by country and top 10 players by goals. Please visit Tableau Public using this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mayank.tripathi3793/viz/UEFAChampionsLeagueDashboard_16902283399830/Dashboard1. Also, find attached a screenshot of the dashboard.
